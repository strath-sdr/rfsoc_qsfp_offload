    "> The RFSoC offload overlay features high-speed data transfer between the RFSoC4x2 board and a computer via the QSFP28 port. QSFP28 allows speeds up to 100 Gbps which enables data to be transferred and processed off-device directly from the RF-ADCs at RF data rates. The offload overlay also contains a data switch and a PS to PL DMA allowing custom payloads to be sent from \n",
